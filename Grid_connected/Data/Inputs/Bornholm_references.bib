abstract = {The technical aspects and economics of bulk hydrogen storage in underground pipes, lined rock caverns (LRC) and salt caverns are analyzed. Hydrogen storage in underground pipes is more economical than in geological caverns for useable amounts {\textless}20-t-H2. However, because the pipe material is a major cost factor, the capital and operating costs for this storage method do not decrease appreciably with an increase in the amount of stored H2. Unlike underground pipes, the installed capital cost of salt caverns decreases appreciably from {\~{}}{\$}95/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to {\textless}{\$}19/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Over the same scale, the annual storage cost decreases from {\~{}}{\$}17/kg-H2 to {\~{}}{\$}3/kg-H2. Like salt caverns, the installed capital cost of lined rock caverns decreases from {\~{}}{\$}160/kg-H2 at 100 t-H2 stored to {\textless}{\$}44/kg-H2 at 3000 t-H2 stored. Storing {\textgreater}750-t useable H2 requires multiple caverns. The cost of salt caverns scales more favorably with size because the salt caverns are larger than lined rock caverns and need to be added at a slower rate as the storage capacity is increased.},

abstract = {The time is right to tap into hydrogen's potential to play a key role in a clean, secure and affordable energy future. At the request of the government of Japan under its G20 presidency, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has produced this landmark report to analyse the current state of play for hydrogen and to offer guidance on its future development. The report finds that clean hydrogen is currently enjoying unprecedented political and business momentum, with the number of policies and projects around the world expanding rapidly. It concludes that now is the time to scale up technologies and bring down costs to allow hydrogen to become widely used. The pragmatic and actionable recommendations to governments and industry that are provided will make it possible to take full advantage of this increasing momentum. Hydrogen can help tackle various critical energy challenges. It offers ways to decarbonise a range of sectors – including long-haul transport, chemicals, and iron and steel – where it is proving difficult to meaningfully reduce emissions. It can also help improve air quality and strengthen energy security. Despite very ambitious international climate goals, global energy-related CO2 emissions reached an all time high in 2018. Outdoor air pollution also remains a pressing problem, with around 3 million people dying prematurely each year. Hydrogen is versatile. Technologies already available today enable hydrogen to produce, store, move and use energy in different ways. A wide variety of fuels are able to produce hydrogen, including renewables, nuclear, natural gas, coal and oil. It can be transported as a gas by pipelines or in liquid form by ships, much like liquefied natural gas (LNG). It can be transformed into electricity and methane to power homes and feed industry, and into fuels for cars, trucks, ships and planes. Hydrogen can enable renewables to provide an even greater contribution. It has the potential to help with variable output from renewables, like solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind, whose availability is not always well matched with demand. Hydrogen is one of the leading options for storing energy from renewables and looks promising to be a lowest-cost option for storing electricity over days, weeks or even months. Hydrogen and hydrogenbased fuels can transport energy from renewables over long distances – from regions with abundant solar and wind resources, such as Australia or Latin America, to energy-hungry cities thousands of kilometres away. There have been false starts for hydrogen in the past; this time could be different. The recent successes of solar PV, wind, batteries and electric vehicles have shown that policy and technology innovation have the power to build global clean energy industries. With a global energy sector in flux, the versatility of hydrogen is attracting stronger interest from a diverse group of governments and companies. Support is coming from governments that both import and export energy as well as renewable electricity suppliers, industrial gas producers, electricity and gas utilities, automakers, oil and gas companies, major engineering firms, and IEA. All rights reserved. The Future of Hydrogen Executive summary PAGE | 14 cities. Investments in hydrogen can help foster new technological and industrial development in economies around the world, creating skilled jobs. Hydrogen can be used much more widely. Today, hydrogen is used mostly in oil refining and for the production of fertilisers. For it to make a significant contribution to clean energy transitions, it also needs to be adopted in sectors where it is almost completely absent at the moment, such as transport, buildings and power generation. However, clean, widespread use of hydrogen in global energy transitions faces several challenges: • Producing hydrogen from low-carbon energy is costly at the moment. IEA analysis finds that the cost of producing hydrogen from renewable electricity could fall 30{\%} by 2030 as a result of declining costs of renewables and the scaling up of hydrogen production. Fuel cells, refuelling equipment and electrolysers (which produce hydrogen from electricity and water) can all benefit from mass manufacturing. • The development of hydrogen infrastructure is slow and holding back widespread adoption. Hydrogen prices for consumers are highly dependent on how many refuelling stations there are, how often they are used and how much hydrogen is delivered per day. Tackling this is likely to require planning and coordination that brings together national and local governments, industry and investors. • Hydrogen is almost entirely supplied from natural gas and coal today. Hydrogen is already with us at industrial scale all around the world, but its production is responsible for annual CO2 emissions equivalent to those of Indonesia and the United Kingdom combined. Harnessing this existing scale on the way to a clean energy future requires both the capture of CO2 from hydrogen production from fossil fuels and greater supplies of hydrogen from clean electricity. • Regulations currently limit the development of a clean hydrogen industry. Government and industry must work together to ensure existing regulations are not an unnecessary barrier to investment. Trade will benefit from common international standards for the safety of transporting and storing large volumes of hydrogen and for tracing the environmental impacts of different hydrogen supplies. IEA. All rights reserved. The Future of Hydrogen Executive summary PAGE | 15 The IEA has identified four near-term opportunities to boost hydrogen on the path towards its clean, widespread use. Focusing on these real-world springboards could help hydrogen achieve the necessary scale to bring down costs and reduce risks for governments and the private sector. While each opportunity has a distinct purpose, all four also mutually reinforce one another. 1. Make industrial ports the nerve centres for scaling up the use of clean hydrogen. Today, much of the refining and chemicals production that uses hydrogen based on fossil fuels is already concentrated in coastal industrial zones around the world, such as the North Sea in Europe, the Gulf Coast in North America and southeastern China. Encouraging these plants to shift to cleaner hydrogen production would drive down overall costs. These large sources of hydrogen supply can also fuel ships and trucks serving the ports and power other nearby industrial facilities like steel plants. 2. Build on existing infrastructure, such as millions of kilometres of natural gas pipelines. Introducing clean hydrogen to replace just 5{\%} of the volume of countries' natural gas supplies would significantly boost demand for hydrogen and drive down costs. 3. Expand hydrogen in transport through fleets, freight and corridors. Powering highmileage cars, trucks and buses to carry passengers and goods along popular routes can make fuel-cell vehicles more competitive. 4. Launch the hydrogen trade's first international shipping routes. Lessons from the successful growth of the global LNG market can be leveraged. International hydrogen trade needs to start soon if it is to make an impact on the global energy system. International co-operation is vital to accelerate the growth of versatile, clean hydrogen around the world. If governments work to scale up hydrogen in a co-ordinated way, it can help to spur investments in factories and infrastructure that will bring down costs and enable the sharing of knowledge and best practices. Trade in hydrogen will benefit from common international standards. As the global energy organisation that covers all fuels and all technologies, the IEA will continue to provide rigorous analysis and policy advice to support international co-operation and to conduct effective tracking of progress in the years ahead. As a roadmap for the future, we are offering seven key recommendations to help governments, companies and others to seize this chance to enable clean hydrogen to fulfil its long-term potential.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on developing a fast-solving open-source model for dynamic power-to-X plant techno-economic analysis and analysing the method bias that occurs when using other state-of-the-art power-to-X cost calculation methods. The model is a least-cost optimisation of investments and operation-costs, taking as input techno-economic data, varying power profiles and hourly grid prices. The fuel analysed is ammonia synthesised from electrolytic hydrogen produced with electricity from photovoltaics, wind turbines or the grid. Various weather profiles and electrolyser technologies are compared. The calculated costs are compared with those derived using methods and assumptions prevailing in most literature. Optimisation results show that a semi-islanded set-up is the cheapest option and can reduce the costs up to 23{\%} compared to off-grid systems but leads to e-fuels GHG emissions similar to fossil fuels with today's electricity blend. For off-grid systems, estimating costs using solar or wind levelized cost of electricity and capacity factors to derive operating hours leads to costs overestimation up to 30{\%}. The cheapest off-grid configuration reaches production costs of 842 €/tNH3. For comparison, the ”grey” ammonia price was 250 €/tNH3 in January 2021 and 1500 €/tNH3 in April 2022 (Western Europe). The optimal power mix is found to always include photovoltaic with 1-axis tracking and sometimes different types of onshore wind turbines at the same site. For systems fully grid connected, approximating a highly fluctuating electricity price by a yearly average and assuming a constant operation leads to a small cost ({\textless}4{\%}) overestimation compared to the more advanced optimisation method applied here.},

abstract = {Power-to-gas and other chemicals-based storages are often suggested for energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. Here we study the North European power and district heat system with alternative long-term storage, the power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology. Assuming fully renewable power and heat sectors and large-scale electrification of road transport, we perform simultaneous optimization of capacity investments and dispatch scheduling of wind, solar, hydro and thermal power, energy storages as well as transmission, focusing on year 2050. We find that P2A has three major roles: it provides renewable feedstock to fertilizer industry and it contributes significantly to system balancing over both time (energy storage) and space (energy transfer). The marginal cost of power-based ammonia production in the studied scenarios varied between 431 and 528 €/t, which is in the range of recent ammonia prices. Costs of P2A plants were dominated by electrolysis. In the power and heat sector, with our cost assumptions, P2A becomes competitive compared to fossil natural gas only if gas price or CO2 emission price rises above 70 €/MWh or 200 €/tCO2.},

abstract = {We report a techno-economic modelling for the flexible production of hydrogen and ammonia from water and optimally combined solar and wind energy. We use hourly data in four locations with world-class solar in the Atacama desert and wind in Patagonia steppes. We find that hybridization of wind and solar can reduce hydrogen production costs by a few percents, when the effect of increasing the load factor on the electrolyser overweighs the electricity cost increase. For ammonia production, the gains by hybridization can be substantially larger, because it reduces the power variability, which is costly, due to the need for intermediate storage of hydrogen between the flexible electrolyser and the less flexible ammonia synthesis unit. Our modelling reveals the crucial role in the synthesis of flexibility, which cuts the cost of variability, especially for the more variable wind power. Our estimated near-term production costs for green hydrogen, around 2 USD/kg, and green ammonia, below 500 USD/t, are encouragingly close to competitiveness against fossil-fuel alternatives.},
